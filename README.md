# Gesture-Recognition
Neural Network Project to Recognise Hand Gestures

Problem Statement
An electronics company which manufactures state of the art smart televisions wants to develop a feature in the smart-TV that can recognize five different gestures performed by the user which will help users control the TV without using a remote.
This TV will continuously monitor the user via a webcam and will classify the input it receives, into 5 categories using a classification model. The TV will then perform the necessary action based on the classification result.
Scope and limitations
The creation of a neural network based video classification model that will help classify the action into the 5 pre-determined classes. All models will be limited to Neural Network models only.
